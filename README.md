# Github Actions Exam Prep

Instead of [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/automate-workflow-github-actions/) material on the same, I'm taking the path of reading GitHub Actions [quickstart documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) directly

### What's on the Exam

1. Author and maintain workflows (40%)
2. Consume workflows (20%)
3. Author and maintain actions (25%)
4. Manage GitHub Actions for the enterprise (15%)
