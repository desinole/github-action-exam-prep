# Github Actions Exam Prep

Instead of [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/automate-workflow-github-actions/) material on the same, I'm taking the path of reading GitHub Actions [quickstart documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) directly

### What's on the Exam

1. Author and maintain workflows (40%)
2. Consume workflows (20%)
3. Author and maintain actions (25%)
4. Manage GitHub Actions for the enterprise (15%)

[Lesson 1: Quickstart build your first GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart#creating-your-first-workflow)


- The resuling action is a [yaml file](https://github.com/desinole/github-action-exam-prep/blob/main/.github/workflows/action1.yml). 
- Beware of indentation pitfalls
- [Repo of starter workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows), has sample workflows by language and deployment env. Note: probably a minute subset on here could be relevant to the exam (just a guess) so review later
- [Repo of complex workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/examples), could be relevant to exam (just a guess)
